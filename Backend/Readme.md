Response Structure
Success Response (201 Created)
If the user registration is successful, the API returns a JSON response containing the generated authentication token and user details.

        "_id": "660b3fef6e2a5f0012345678",

            "lastName": "Doe"
        },
        "email": "johndoe@example.com"
    }
}

Error Responses
400 Bad Request
Occurs if validation fails (e.g., missing fields, invalid email format, weak password, etc.).

Example Response:

{
    "errors": [
        {
            "msg": "First Name must be at least 3 characters Long",
            "param": "fullName.firstName",
            "location": "body"
        },
        {
            "msg": "Invalid Email",
            "param": "email",
            "location": "body"
        }
    ]
}

500 Internal Server Error
Occurs if there is an unexpected error during user creation.

Example Response:

{
    "message": "Internal Server Error"
}

Notes
Passwords are securely hashed before storing in the database.

If the email is already registered, a unique constraint error will occur.

The token returned is a JSON Web Token (JWT) used for authentication.
